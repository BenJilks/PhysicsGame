Backend:
    - Allow user to sign into different servers in which they can compete
      (Perhaps have a server per school)

    - Implement login system with sql (standard hash/salt combination)

    - Create expandable lobby system based on turns

    - Sort out server API

    - Implement http request-based lobby client-server communication system

    - Add score calculation system for each of the games

    - Create question database, use question ID to store answered questions
      for each user as to have a property of questions-answered in profile
      statistics

    - Handle frequency with which answered-wrongly questions are answered - 
      more commonly wrong answered questions come up more

    - Provide offline/online status tracking for automatic lobbying

    - Add lobby invite system

Frontend:
    - Create a page for joining classes within which people can compete 
      (Perhaps have a server per school)

    - Add login form (dont create a new html/body just literally make a div
      in a file we got handlebars to do the rest server-side)

    - Use dark theme by default like a normal UI - would be made easier if 
      the game mode graphics were CSS generated

    - Remove unnecessary rounded corners from the top of the nav bar - it looks
      ridiculous

    - Homepage should not be displaying game modes rather information about the 
      site and the game related controls should be contained within the user 
      dashboard instead
